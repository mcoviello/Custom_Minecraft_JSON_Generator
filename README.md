# Custom_Minecraft_JSON_Generator

## What Do It Do
This program generates JSON files for custom Minecraft Block Sets, for use in **Fabric Modding**.
This is a fairly hacky project I've thrown together to speed up some modding I'm doing, so while 
it definitely needs a lot of improvement, hopefully it can save *someone* some manual labour! üòÅ
## To Use:
Change the PATH environment variable to match the Fabric assets directory on your project.
Run the program with the desired name of the block in the respective method.
The methods provided automate generating the JSON files for a full building, armour and item set for a given material.
